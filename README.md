# Cat Dog Classifier with Heroku Deployment
[Play with the App](https://catdogclassifiercnn.herokuapp.com/)

A simple Flask App that can classify an image as Dog or Cat
using a Convolutional Neural Network Model. I build this as a part of my Deep Learning course and
deploy my First Deep learning model and have something I can send
to friends so they can upload their images of their face and let my app
insult them :wink:
